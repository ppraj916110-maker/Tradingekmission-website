    <h1>Beginner Stock Market Course</h1>
    
    <p>A beginner's course on the stock market is designed to provide you with the fundamental knowledge and skills needed to start investing. These courses typically cover a wide range of topics, from basic definitions to practical strategies.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts You'll Learn</h2>
    
    <p>A comprehensive beginner's course will typically include the following modules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Introduction to Investing:</strong> This covers the "why" and "how" of investing, including the difference between saving and investing, and the risks and rewards associated with it.</li>
        <li><strong>Understanding the Stock Market:</strong> You'll learn about what a stock is, what a stock exchange does (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ), and the difference between primary and secondary markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Terminology:</strong> The course will demystify common jargon like "bull market," "bear market," "IPO" (Initial Public Offering), and "dividends."</li>
        <li><strong>Types of Investments:</strong> You'll be introduced to different investment instruments, such as individual stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds).</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis Methods:</strong> Courses often provide an overview of both fundamental analysis (evaluating a company's financial health) and technical analysis (studying price charts and trends).</li>
        <li><strong>Setting Up Your Account:</strong> You'll learn the practical steps of opening a Demat and trading account with a broker.</li>
        <li><strong>Building a Strategy:</strong> Courses will help you understand how to define your investment goals, determine your risk tolerance, and create a diversified portfolio.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> You'll learn how to manage risk, including the importance of diversification and avoiding common mistakes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Before You Begin</h2>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p>Before you start investing real money, it's highly recommended to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Set Clear Goals:</strong> Know why you are investing and what you hope to achieve.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand Your Risk Tolerance:</strong> Be honest with yourself about how much risk you're comfortable with.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice with a Simulator:</strong> Many platforms offer virtual trading or stock market simulators where you can practice trading without using real money. This can be a great way to apply what you've learned and get a feel for the market.</li>
            <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Begin with a small amount of money that you can afford to lose. This allows you to gain experience and confidence without significant financial risk.</li>
        </ol>
